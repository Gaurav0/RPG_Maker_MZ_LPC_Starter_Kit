FAQ
===

The screen is too small / too big in my browser!
---

Try pressing F3 to enable stretch mode. Press F4 afterward to go full screen.

Where are the Credits / Licenses ?
---

For now they are with the assets. I did a first pass at a Credits screen, but it needs work. You can find it on the title menu.

Why don't I see the map in RPG Maker MZ?
---

I am using TileD and the VisuStella TileD plugin because the RPG Maker MZ map editor doesn't support all the features LPC tilesets provide, plus I would have to reformat the tilests. To view the map, open the map in TileD. You can export the map as an image to use as a parallax; this can be a guide while you create your events. To sum up, do your mapping in TileD, and your eventing in RPG Maker MZ.
