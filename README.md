FAQ

Why don't I see the map in RPG Maker MZ?
---

I am using TileD and the VisuStella TileD plugin because the RPG Maker MZ map editor doesn't support all the features LPC tilesets provide. To view the map, open the map in TileD. You can export the map as an image to use as a parallax; this can be a guide while
you create your events. To sum up, do your mapping in TileD, and your eventing in RPG Maker MZ.
