# Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC) Starter Kit for RPG Maker MZ / TileD Map Editor

Despite the massive amount of completely free assets available under the Liberated Pixel Cup Project at OpenGameArt.org it is not widely used. One of the reasons could be that it is not obvious how to get started with it in some of the most widely used game engines.

The most widely used 2D RPG game engine at the moment is RPG Maker MZ. This project is an attempt to make it a bit simpler to get started using LPC art to make an RPG using that software.

## FAQ

### The screen is too small / too big in my browser!

Try pressing F3 to enable stretch mode. Press F4 afterward to go full screen.

### Where are the Credits / Licenses ?

I've done a couple of passes at an in game credits screen, but it still needs some work. You can find it on the title menu. Until it is fully complete, please find the full attributions alongside the files in this repository.

### Why are you using TileD Map Editor? Why not only use the mapping tools in RPG Maker MZ?

I am using TileD and the VisuStella TileD plugin because the RPG Maker MZ map editor doesn't support all the features LPC tilesets require, such as translucent tiles. As a bonus, it helps immensely to have unlimited layers and flexibility in collision mapping.

In addition, I would have to reformat the tilests to RPG Maker MZ's format, which would take significant effort and would need to be redone each time those tilesets are updated. 

### Why don't I see the map in RPG Maker MZ?

To view the map, open the map in TileD. You can export the map as an image to use as a parallax; this can be a guide while you create your events. To sum up, do your mapping in TileD, and your eventing in RPG Maker MZ.

### Can I use the code / art from this repository in my commercial game?

YES. Everything in this repository other than RPG Maker MZ core scripts is open source. Please observe the terms of all the licenses for each RPG Maker MZ plugin and all of the art in the repository. Please attribute where required. Feel free to use my Credits screen and add to it.

Payment is only required for RPG Maker MZ base software. There is no royalty, just a one time payment per user. See license for RPG Maker MZ for further information.

Regardless of whether explicitly stated in each file, consider the code in this repository as derivative of RPG Maker MZ and subject to its terms of use. Do not use, modify, or distribute your modifications unless you have purchased RPG Maker MZ for each user.
