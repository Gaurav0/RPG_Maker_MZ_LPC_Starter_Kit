FAQ

Where are the Credits / Licenses ?
---

For now they are with the assets. I will be adding a Credits screen at some point.

Why don't I see the map in RPG Maker MZ?
---

I am using TileD and the VisuStella TileD plugin because the RPG Maker MZ map editor doesn't support all the features LPC tilesets provide, plus I would have to reformat the tilests. To view the map, open the map in TileD. You can export the map as an image to use as a parallax; this can be a guide while you create your events. To sum up, do your mapping in TileD, and your eventing in RPG Maker MZ.
